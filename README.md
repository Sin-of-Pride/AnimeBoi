# Why a Recommendation System

# Recommendatin System
1) Content Based Recommendation System
In the content-based recommender system, we will only consider the synopsis and metadata of the anime. This recommendation will return the most similar items based of the input anime we gave.

Advantages :
Can overcome 'cold start' problem when we're using the collaborative filtering where new item that didn't have enough rating will not be recommended.

Disadvantages :
Result may not be satisfying as it's difficult to rate a complex item by its metadata only.
Tend to return on similar items such as the sequel or the 2nd season of that anime.

2) Rating Based Recommendation System
In the Rating Based recommender system, we will only consider the rating given by user to give recommendation. This recommendation will return preferred anime by previous users who rated highly on the input anime.

Advantages :
Result are often better than content-based, because it can give recommendation without the machine analyzing complex object such as anime from its metadata.

Disadvantages :
Will face 'cold start' problem when new item that didn't have enough rating will not be recommended.
Requires big amount of rating data before it can generate satisfying result.
